This repository contains all files in the class CLIMATE 410. Including: 
* Homework assignments
* Lab reports
* Final project

Lab 1: 
1. cd to lab_1 directory
2. run this in command line: sh run_lab1.sh --experiment=1
3. parameters for bash: experiment from 1 to 3. 

Lab2: 
* Before running the script, navigate to the lab's root directory in your command line interface:
`cd lab_2`
* To perform the initial validation and run all three experiments in a single command, use:
`sh run_ode.sh --validation --exp1 --exp2 --exp3`
* You can choose to run any combination of the experiments by specifying only the flags you need. 
`sh run_ode.sh --exp2`
